        <p>
          We are a team of students disillusioned by the lectures of
          entrepreneurship on campus — we believe learning is best done by
          doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are making a bet on student potential — student builders have
          created this generation's most impactful products like Facebook,
          Dropbox, Reddit, and DoorDash. We are super bullish on what Pitt's
          talent can achieve.

          We’re talking about initiatives like Pitt's very own national startup
          career fair to help you land internships, software products with
          recurring revenue, and networking events to accelerate your college
          career.
